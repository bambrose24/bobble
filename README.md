# Bobble

A clone of Wordle that lets you play more than once!

- UI based on MUI, built with React.
- Client-side only, saved states in local storage using `redux-persist`.
- Word list found online, not sure where but it's not a source-of-truth. The valid guesses words are in the scrabble dictionary, and the answers are chosen from the hopefully-more-known words list.

To get going with this, build the project with

```
$ yarn build
```

and run it with 
```
$ yarn start
```

After this you should be able to build on top of what I have if you want.

I host this on https://bobble.fun via Netlify.

Feel free to fork or do as you please!
